# Cplusplus
Project Summary:
This project utilizes C++ in a console application that allows a user to analyze sales data from a text-based document. The file reads the document, calculates the frequency of each item and presents the information through an interactive menu. It allows the user to see the information by specific item, a simple histogram, or an advanced color-coded histogram that represents the order in which items are purchased to show case trends by time of day for purchases. The program also has extensive error and testing features.

What I did well:
This program emphasized a strict degree of modularity. It breaks the program into distinct, single purpose components that could be reused across other projects.

What opportunities does this solution still have:
This projectâ€™s biggest opportunity is managing scope creep. I treated this project as an opportunity to increase my overall knowledge and experience using C++ and added features that were outside the original requirements of the project. The addition of the randomly generated test files, as well as the histogram were the most challenging components of the program but neither of them were a part of the guidance for the assignment. These additions also were brought in after the original assignment was completed and I was working on polishing the solution, so they were not integrated in the beginning which led to overall program having multiple solutions to the same problem such as using a Map and a Vector to both solve the same problem of tracking the information from the file. If this had been part of the original planned features, then the program could have used a single solution. The inclusion of the randomly generated test file does not need to be included on the user side as its stated purpose is to test the program not actually enhance the user experience.

Concluding Thoughts:
This project offered a great learning opportunity to enhance my comfortability with C++ as well as take me past just knowing how to implement classes and modularity, understanding the reasons for why to use them, what advantages they bring and what opportunities to watch for while using them. This project was not as tightly written as it could be, but the expansion of its features has greatly prepared me for my future of working with different programming languages and finding optimal solutions to unique problems.
