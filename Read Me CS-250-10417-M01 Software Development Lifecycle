How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this? When looking at user needs, I try to focus on the actual business value or goal the user wants to accomplish, rather than just reading through technical specs. 
Using "user stories" helps a lot with this because it frames the requirements directly from the user's point of view. When you pair these stories with specific Acceptance Criteria, it gives the developers and testers a very clear "Definition of Done." 
It takes the guesswork out of the process and keeps everyone focused on the final user experience.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? I try to approach development as a flexible, iterative process instead of a rigid, linear one. 
Since client needs and market research can change suddenly, my goal is to write clean, adaptable code that can be updated without breaking the core application. 
In the future, I definitely want to keep using Agile processes like Sprints and Daily Scrums. 
Working in shorter cycles allows for constant testing and feedback, which helps prevent massive late-stage bugs and keeps the software relevant to what the client actually wants.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? Being a good team member in software development really comes down to clear communication and adaptability.
Because frameworks like Scrum are so collaborative, a solid team member asks questions early—like double-checking wireframes or data fields before coding starts—so the rest of the team doesn't hit a bottleneck.
It also means respecting the different roles on the team while being ready to pivot and help out when sudden requirement changes or interruptions happen.
